Welcome to my kernel!!

In this project, I aim to conduct exploratory data analysis and make predictions
using the Logistic Regression and K Nearest Neighbors algorithm in the wine quality dataset.

The wine quality dataset is a popular dataset in which it is possible to deploy classification
algorithms.

It has 11 predictor variables and 1 response variable and given various factors,
the aim is to predict the quality of the wine

After the necessary preprocessing tasks, upon deployment, both the models attained an
impressive 98% accuracy

Please refer to the .ipynb kernel attached to view the project.


Thank you so much!!!!
